  abstract =     "This tutorial will introduce the NLP community to
                  Item Response Theory (IRT). IRT is a method from
                  the field of psychometrics for model and dataset assessment. 
                  IRT has been used for decades to build test sets for human
                  subjects and estimate latent characteristics of dataset examples.
                  Recently, there has been an uptick in work applying IRT to tasks in NLP.
                  It is our goal to introduce the wider NLP community to IRT and show its benefits for a number of NLP tasks. 
                  From this tutorial, we hope to encourage wider adoption of IRT among NLP researchers."
